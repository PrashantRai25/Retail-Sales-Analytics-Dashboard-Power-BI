Power BI Retail Analytics: Top-N Ranking, Class Segmentation & Trend Analysis
This project delivers a complete Retail Sales Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI, SQL, DAX, and Power Query. It analyzes sales performance across multiple dimensions including subcategory, item code, product class, and monthly trends. The report includes dynamic Top-N selections, ranking logic, class-wise segmentation (Head, Superhead, Belly, Tail), and growth KPIs to help business teams identify key drivers of revenue and quantity.

The dashboard is powered by a clean Star Schema, SQL-based ETL (joins, views, window functions), and optimized DAX measures such as growth %, ranking, previous month comparisons, and cumulative contribution.
This project demonstrates strong BI modeling skills and real-world retail analytics expertise suited for Power BI Developer and Data Analyst roles.
